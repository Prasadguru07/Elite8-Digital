PortGuru is a modern, responsive portfolio website built using React, Vite, and TypeScript. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion for smooth animations, and React Router for navigation between pages. 

To run the project locally, you need to have Node.js (version 16 or above) installed on your machine. 

1. First, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to store the project. 
2. Clone the repository from GitHub using git clone or download the ZIP and extract it. Once you are inside the project folder, run npm install to install all the required dependencies defined in the package.json file.
3. After the installation completes, you can start the development server by running npm run dev.
   
This will launch the app in your browser at http://localhost:5173, where you can view your site in real-time.
